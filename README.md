## About

This project is inspired by the iconic Spotify Wrapped. Instead of waiting for my year-end summary, I decided to analyze my monthly streaming habits by using an external API applet to automatically collect and track my streaming data. The goal of this project is to explore and visualize patterns in my listening behavior, highlighting my top artists, favorite songs, and peak streaming days each month. You can check out my latest statistics on my [Spotify Wrapped dashboard](https://matteo-torres.shinyapps.io/shinydashboard/).
