## **Welcome** 

Yay! You've made it to my Spotify Wrapped dashboard!

This has been a passion project of mine that I've been working on during my *"free"* time. I initially wanted to create something fun using the data science skills I've gained from my graduate program. Additionally, I aimed to develop a project that reflects my personality and interests. As someone who always has a set of headphones on, I thought it would be really cool to create a dashboard to analyze my monthly Spotify streaming data. 

This project is still a work in progress, but I am excited to share it with you! I welcome your thoughts, feedback, and creative ideas, so please don’t hesitate to reach out. Feel free to explore the dashboard, and don’t be shy to listen to the playlist preview I’ve linked, so you can hear snippets of what’s currently on repeat for me!
