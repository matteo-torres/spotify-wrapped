# **Welcome**

## YAY! You've made it to my Spotify Wrapped dashboard! 

## This is a passion project that I've been working on during my *"free"* time.

## I wanted to create something fun with the data science skills that I have gained during grad school that also reflects my personality and interests. As someone who *ALWAYS* has a pair of headphones on, I thought it would be cool to create a dashboard to analyze my monthly Spotify streaming habits.

## This project is still a work in progress, but I am so excited to share this with you! 

## Your thoughts, feedback, or cool ideas are always welcome, so don't hestitate to [reach out](mailto:matteotorres@bren.ucsb.edu).

## I hope you like it!

## P.S. Don't be shy... click the playlist preview to hear what's currently on repeat for me while you look around!

## Until the next update...

## Love,
## Matteo <3
