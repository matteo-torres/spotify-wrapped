On the monthly Spotify streaming tab, you can find details about the total number of artists and songs streamed each month, my top artists and songs, information about the highest streaming day, and what time of day I was most active. I also created a playlist with the top 10 most streamed songs along with a bonus track from the top artist of the month. This playlist is intended to evolve each month to reflect what I had onn repeat over the past month. Feel free to click play on the preview while you scroll through the dashboard!
