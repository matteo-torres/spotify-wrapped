I curated a Spotify playlist featuring my top 10 songs of the month, along with a bonus track from my top artist. This playlist is intended to evolve each month to reflect what I had on repeat over the past month. For more details, the monthly streaming tab contains additional information about the number of times I streamed each song and how many times I streamed the bonus track from my top artist. Feel free to click the play button, located on the playlist preview, to hear short snippets of the playlist while you explore the dashboard!
