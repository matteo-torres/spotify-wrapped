**Addison** (2025)

*Addison* is the self-titled debut album by Addison Rae. It is proclaimed to be the first and last release from the artist under the full alias "Addison Rae," as the young starlet plans to rebrand and continue her career as "Addison."  This transition is highly reflective and suitable for the album's purpose of leaving behind the name that is tied to the fabricated image assigned during her rise to fame. In this album, Addison opens up and shows a more authentic side to her experiences and struggles while navigating the rises and falls of fame. It explores relatable themes such as seeking escapism, experiencing young love, and simply being a young woman in her twenties. However, it also delves into more direct and personal themes, such as fame and fortune, materialism, her parents' divorce, and losing her sense of self. It evokes feelings of freedom and liberation, overthinking, insecurity, uncertainty, and acceptance. Addison is open to experimenting with different sounds and genres but stays true to creating an experience and vibe. While the longevity of Addison's career is unpredictable, she seems prepared for the challenge as she lives by the mantra, "Life is no fun through clear waters."

**Hot** (2025)

*HOT* is the fifth EP by South Korean pop group LE SSERAFIM. It serves as the third and final installment in their trilogy, which includes *EASY*, *CRAZY*, and *HOT*. The concept *HOT* is described as an internal flame — one that burns brightly in darkness but is also susceptible to being burned down to ashes. The EP explores themes such as love, passion, self-harm, and rebirth, conveying emotions of confidence, flirtation, loss, and resilience. LE SSERAFIM consistently experiments with various music genres throughout their discography, offering unique sounds that are not often found in K-pop. With *HOT*, they continue to push boundaries by incorporating influences from disco, nu-jazz, and jersey club, thus redefining traditional K-pop music.

**Virgin** (2025)

*Virgin* is the fourth studio album by Lorde. The album title is a double entendre, reflecting on the artist's past life when they were young, inexperienced, and impressionable. It takes on a lens of rebirth when the artist has regained power, strength, and independence from male control, similar to the virgin Greek goddesses Hestia, Artemis, and Athena. It touches upon many complex and uncomfortable themes, such as lingering past traumas, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, sex and impurity, illicit drug use, and emotional abuse, evoking feelings of shame, lust, rage, and reflection. Like the famous artist Michaelangelo, this piece starts with a hammer and ends with the statue of David, a symbol of courage and strength. As the album progresses, it is quite uncanny how representative it is in the way Michaelangelo describes creating him, "...he was already there. I just chipped everything away that wasn't David."
